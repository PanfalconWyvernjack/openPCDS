# Testing Product Code

Regardless of chosen framework / backend / DB, we should have one testing suite that targets specific endpoints. This should allow us to save time by writing tests once. This may also have the side benefit of aiding in overall application design before commiting to a specific technology.

# Potential Testing Frameworks

- Cypress
- WDIO 
- JEST (JS FE)
